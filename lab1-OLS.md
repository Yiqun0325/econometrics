# HS 409A Lab: OLS Review

**Goal:** To test assumptions for OLS using a dataset in Stata

### Objectives: 
1.	Review Stata codes for descriptive statistics and linear regression
2.	Check OLS assumptions

**Research Question:** What factors are associated with deaths due to coronary heart disease?
Dataset: Annual mortality rates due to heart disease and other potentially related variables from 1947-1980. (N=34 years)

**Model:**

#### Preliminary steps in Stata:  
* Download and save Stata data file in a folder
* Begin a log by clicking on the “Log” icon on the top center panel; save the log in the designated folder.
* Begin a “Do-file” by clicking on the icon on the top center panel; save the do-file in the designated folder.
